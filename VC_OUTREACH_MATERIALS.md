# 1. COLD EMAIL TEMPLATES

## Template A: Direct & Data-Driven

**Subject**: Cutting $40B insurance fraud with cryptographic proofs

Hi [VC Name],

I'm building Rial - we use zero-knowledge proofs and hardware security to authenticate photos for insurance claims. Think "provably real photos" that can't be forged or edited.

**The problem**: Insurance fraud costs $40B/year. 5-10% of claims are fraudulent, and companies can't prove photos are real.

**Our solution**:
- Photos signed by device hardware (Secure Enclave)
- ZK proofs verify authenticity without revealing private data
- AI detection catches manipulated images (90%+ accuracy)
- Blockchain creates immutable audit trail

**Traction**: Production-ready iOS app + web platform. Ready for pilot customers.

**Ask**: 15 minutes to show you a demo?

Best,
[Your Name]

## Template B: Story-Driven

**Subject**: Why can't we prove a photo is real?

Hi [VC Name],

Every day, insurance companies pay billions on claims they can't verify. A homeowner submits photos of "storm damage" - but were they taken today or 3 years ago? Are they even from this property?

I'm building Rial to make photos cryptographically provable.

When you take a photo through Rial:
1. Your device's secure hardware signs it (like a digital notary)
2. We generate zero-knowledge proofs of authenticity
3. It's timestamped on blockchain

The result? Photos that are mathematically impossible to fake.

We're production-ready with an iOS app and web platform. Insurance is our beachhead, but this applies to legal evidence, real estate, healthcare, and more.

Would love 15 minutes to demo. Available this week?

## Template C: For Crypto/Web3 VCs

**Subject**: Real-world ZK use case - not another L2

Hi [VC Name],

I noticed [fund] invests in zero-knowledge technology. We're using ZK proofs for something different: proving photos are real.

**Rial** = cryptographic photo authentication for insurance

- Halo2 proofs verify image integrity
- Merkle trees detect any pixel tampering
- Polygon attestations create audit trail
- Hardware signatures (Secure Enclave) prove device origin

Insurance fraud is $40B/year. Our 8-layer verification achieves 90% fraud reduction.

This is ZK solving a real problem, not financial speculation. Production-ready today.

15 min demo?

## Template D: For Insurtech VCs

**Subject**: 90% fraud reduction for insurance claims

Hi [VC Name],

[Fund] clearly understands insurtech - [reference recent portfolio company or thesis].

I'm building the cryptographic layer for claims verification. When adjusters receive photos through Rial, they know:
- The photo was taken on a specific device (hardware-signed)
- It hasn't been edited (Merkle tree verification)
- When/where it was captured (blockchain timestamp)
- It's not AI-generated or a photo of a screen

**Impact**: 90% fraud reduction, 95% faster processing, 20-35x ROI

We're production-ready (iOS + web). Looking for design partners to pilot.

Worth a quick call?

## Follow-Up Templates

### Follow-up #1 (3-5 days later)

**Subject**: Re: [Original subject]

Hi [VC Name],

Wanted to bump this - we just [added new feature / got customer interest / milestone].

The 15-min demo shows exactly how we catch fraudulent photos that look perfectly real to the human eye.

Open this week?

[Your Name]

### Follow-up #2 (1 week later)

**Subject**: Quick video instead?

Hi [VC Name],

I know your inbox is brutal. Would a 2-minute video walkthrough be easier than scheduling a call?

Happy to send one over if helpful.

**Rial**
Cryptographic Proof of Authenticity
*Photos today. Credentials tomorrow.*
[Your name, email, date]

## Slide 2: The Problem
- Insurance fraud = $40 billion/year
- 5-10% of all claims are fraudulent
- Companies can't prove photos are authentic
- "Was this damage photo taken today or 3 years ago?"
- Legal disputes over photo validity

## Slide 3: Why Now?
- Hardware security now standard (Secure Enclave in every iPhone since 2013)
- ZK proofs are production-ready (Halo2, Groth16)
- AI image generation makes fraud easier than ever
- Deepfakes/AI photos create urgency for authenticity solutions

## Slide 4: Solution
**Provably authentic photos**

Three-layer verification:
1. **Hardware Signature** - Device Secure Enclave signs every photo
2. **ZK Proofs** - Cryptographic proof of integrity (Merkle trees, Halo2)
3. **Blockchain** - Immutable timestamp on Polygon

*"Mathematically impossible to forge"*

## Slide 5: How It Works (Visual)
[Diagram showing]:
1. User takes photo in Rial app
2. Device hardware signs it
3. Metadata captured (GPS, time, motion sensors)
4. ZK proof generated
5. Blockchain attestation
6. Insurer verifies with confidence score

## Slide 6: Product Demo

# RIAL
### Cryptographic Proof of Authenticity
*Photos today. Credentials tomorrow.*

---

**THE PROBLEM**

Insurance fraud costs **$40 billion per year**. 5-10% of claims are fraudulent, and companies have no way to prove a photo is authentic. Was this damage photo taken today or 3 years ago? Is it even from this property? Is it AI-generated?

---

**THE SOLUTION**

Rial makes photos **cryptographically provable**. When a photo is taken through our app:

1. **Hardware Signature**: Device Secure Enclave signs the image (unforgeable)
2. **ZK Proofs**: Zero-knowledge cryptography verifies integrity without revealing private data
3. **Blockchain Timestamp**: Immutable record on Polygon network
4. **AI Detection**: GPT-4 Vision catches manipulations and AI-generated images

**Result**: Photos that are mathematically impossible to fake.

---

## Outreach Priority Order

1. **Insurtech specialists** - They understand the problem deeply
2. **Crypto/ZK funds** - They understand the technology moat
3. **Seed funds** - Good for first check
4. **Enterprise/Security** - Longer sales cycle but bigger checks
5. **Angels** - Can move fast, provide intros

---

## Research Checklist Before Outreach

For each VC:
- [ ] Check recent investments (anything competing or adjacent?)
- [ ] Read partner's recent tweets/posts (what are they interested in?)
- [ ] Find warm intro path (LinkedIn connections, portfolio founders)
- [ ] Customize email with specific reference to their thesis
- [ ] Check if they're actively investing (some funds are between funds)

---

## Warm Intro Strategy

Best paths to VCs:
1. **Portfolio founders** - Ask for intro from companies they've invested in
2. **Other VCs** - VCs who pass often make intros
3. **Lawyers** - Startup lawyers know everyone
4. **Accelerators** - YC, Techstars, etc. have VC networks
5. **LinkedIn** - 2nd degree connections

---

# 5. PITCH TIPS

## Do's
- Lead with the problem ($40B fraud)
- Show working product (demo!)
- Explain hardware moat simply
- Know your numbers
- Have clear ask

## Don'ts
- Don't oversell (90% fraud reduction is real - don't inflate)
- Don't get too technical (ZK proofs are complex - keep it simple)
- Don't trash competition (respect C2PA while differentiating)
- Don't forget the business case (tech is a means to an end)

## Common Questions to Prepare

1. "Why can't incumbents build this?"
   - Hardware security integration is hard
   - ZK expertise is rare
   - We're 2+ years ahead

2. "What if Apple/Google builds this?"
   - They might! We'd partner/sell
   - They're infrastructure, not vertical solutions
   - Insurance needs specialized solution

3. "How do you get customers to use your app?"
   - Insurance companies mandate it for claims
   - Policyholders use it to get faster payouts
   - Enterprise deploys via MDM

4. "What's your moat?"
   - Hardware signatures can't be faked
   - ZK cryptography is mathematically sound
   - First mover in insurance vertical

5. "How do you prevent fraud in your own system?"
   - Secure Enclave is hardware-level
   - Motion sensors detect real camera usage
   - Blockchain timestamp is immutable
