# ✅ SUCCESS! YOUR APP CONNECTED!

## 🎉 **WHAT I SEE IN YOUR LOGS:**

```
🔧 USING PUBLIC URL WITH DATABASE
✅ Response status: 200
✅ Proof generated successfully
⏱️ Photo Certification: 2187ms
✅ Saved to gallery (44 images!)
```

**YOUR APP CONNECTED TO THE BACKEND!** 🎊

The /prove endpoint worked! Backend responded with 200!

---

## 📊 **DATABASE CHECK:**

```
Current photos in database: 2
(These are from my test uploads)
```

**Why your photo isn't there yet:**
- The /prove endpoint doesn't store in database (just responds)
- Need to also call /api/verify-photo endpoint
- Or update /prove to store in database

---

## 🔧 **LET ME FIX THIS:**

I'll update the backend so /prove ALSO stores in database!

**Your photo WAS verified (200 response)!**  
**Just need to store it!**

---

**LET ME UPDATE THE BACKEND TO STORE ON /prove ENDPOINT...**

**Give me 1 minute!** 💪
